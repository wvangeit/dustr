.SH NAME
dustr \- Rust-based disk usage analyzer with histogram visualization
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dustr
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] [\fIDIRECTORY\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dustr
is a Rust-based implementation of duk, a command-line utility that shows disk usage statistics in a directory with a histogram visualization. It provides improved performance over the original Python implementation while maintaining the same functionality.
.PP
The tool displays a histogram of disk usage for all items in a directory, showing the size of each file and subdirectory along with a visual representation of their relative sizes.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Print help information and exit
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Print version information and exit
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\-inodes
Count inodes (files and directories) instead of measuring disk usage in kilobytes
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-sort
Sort output by size in ascending order (default is to sort by name)
.TP
.BR \-r ", " \-\-reverse
Reverse the sort order
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I DIRECTORY
The directory to analyze (default: current directory)
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Show disk usage for the current directory:
.PP
.RS
.B dustr
.RE
.PP
Show disk usage for a specific directory:
.PP
.RS
.B dustr /path/to/directory
.RE
.PP
Count inodes instead of disk usage:
.PP
.RS
.B dustr \-\-inodes
.RE
.PP
Sort by size in descending order:
.PP
.RS
.B dustr \-\-sort \-\-reverse
.RE
.SH OUTPUT
The output displays:
.IP \(bu 2
Size in kBytes (or inode count with \-\-inodes)
.IP \(bu 2
Percentage of total usage
.IP \(bu 2
Histogram visualization using '#' characters
.IP \(bu 2
Name of the file or directory
.PP
At the end, the total directory size is displayed.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Success
.TP
.B 1
An error occurred (e.g., permission denied, directory not found, user interrupted)
